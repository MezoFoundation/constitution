### Holons:
A holon is a grouping of similar function within a Mezo system.

Citizens may go to any holon they choose, and movement between holons is allowed at any time.

![Two Holons](https://github.com/mezounion/constitution/blob/master/twocircles.png)

There are two types of holon. A standing holon is a holon that is permanent and is the basis the creation and defines special holon. A special holon is a holon that combines aspects from multiple standing holons.

![A Special Holon is the Intersection of Two Holons](https://github.com/mezounion/constitution/blob/master/intersect.jpeg)

Aside from the founding standing holons, new standing holons can only be formed with 90% Mezono consensus.

A standing holon can be removed given at least 90% Mezono consensus within said standing holon and at least a 90% consensus among all Mezonos.

A citizen in a special holon is considered to be (1/(number of standing holons the special holon is comprised of)) of a citizen within each holon the special holon is comprised of.

Labor can not be forced in or between holons.

Trade of services is allowed.

Trade of voting power for goods or services is not allowed.

Trade of goods is not allowed within holons.

Trade of goods is not allowed between holons.

Trade of goods is not allowed between a holon and another institution.

### Mezonos
Criteria | Information
------------ | -------------
Name | Mezono
Symbol | Ƶ
Abbreviation | MZO

Interaction with the resource pool is facilitated with Mezonos.

Mezonos can not be transferred between citizens/organizations.

Citizens/Organizations can not own private property.

When a citizen moves holons the Mezonos associated with that holon do not move with the citizen. The Mezonos are then redistributed among the citizens of the holon.
  
When a citizen moves holons the resources associated with that holon do not move with the citizen, resources are then returned to the resource pool.

Mezonos represent shares in voting.

Mezonos are distributed to standing holons only.
  
The more citizens a standing holon has the less Mezonos the holon will receive.

The less citizens a standing holon has the more Mezonos the holon will receive.

A standing holon’s Mezonos are divided equally amongst all full citizens of a standing holon. Partial citizens who are in a special holon receive 

((the amount a full citizen within a standing holon connected to the special holon receives)/(number of standing holons the special holon is comprised of))

from each standing holon their special holon is comprised of.

The minimum number of Mezonos in a Mezo system must be equal to the number of citizens within that Mezo system.

The minimium number of Mezonos that can be given to a citizen is equal to the amount of Mezonos needed to buy a munit.

### Mezono Accounting
Every citizen has a “allocation”, a “balance”, and an “amount spent”.

The allocation of a citizen is the amount of Mezonos a Mezo system allocates to a person on the assumption that they have not spent any Mezonos.

The amount spent of a citizen is the number of Mezonos they have spent.

The balance of a citizen is the current amount of Mezonos a citizen has. It is equal to the allocation amount minus the amount spent.

Mezono balance can never be below zero. This means a citizen may not move to a different holon if the new holon would allocate less than the amount the citizen has spent.

Frozen Mezonos does not mean that the number of Mezonos a citizen is allocated is fixed but rather that they can not do anything with those Mezonos.

[PERSONAL MEZONO ALLOCATION = TO AMOUNT OF MEZONO NEEDED TO BUY A MUNIT, this is the amount a citizen is allowed to spend on personal affairs. A person may not spend more than the personal mezono allocation amount on personal affairs. HOW TO DETERMINE PERSONAL ALLOCATION AMOUNT. IDEALLY IS MAXIMUM AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOWERING SYSTEMS ABILITY TO PROVIDE EVERYONE THAT PERSONAL ALLOCATION AMOUNT]

### Organizations
Anyone can create an organization at any time.

A citizen can be a part of multiple organizations at the same time.

Organizations are comprised of citizens who give the right to an amount of their mezonos to an organization. However, giving the right to these mezonos does not mean that the organization can use that citizen's mezono's voting power. The citizen gives the right to spend an amount of their mezonos to the organization but may retain the voting power associated with those mezonos.

Organizations can interact with the resource pool.

There is a difference between voting power and organizational voting power.

Inside of an organization a citizen has organizational voting power equal to the (% of their tokens they give to the organization)/(number of members).

Organizations can only be formed between members of the same standing/special holon.

A citizen can give any amount of their voting power within an organization to anyone else within that organization. A citizen may take back their voting power at any time.

An organization can have any internal rules as determined by the citizens who comprise them. (This includes consensus rules, what percent consensus is necessary for decisions, whether the organization is open or closed for other people to join, etc.)
[This may also comprise of a measure of education and tests of ability required to join]

When an organization produces a good and exchanges it for mezonos, the mezonos are redistributed to citizens equal to the (percent of their mezonos they give to the organization)/(# of members).

A citizen can leave an organization at any time. However, when choosing to withdraw their Mezonos and 
[WHAT IF I LEAVE AN ORGANIZATION BEFORE GETTING Mezonos BACK? Perhaps forced liquidation? or perhaps I can leave the organization in terms of my work but I will not be reimbursed the Mezonos until the organization produces something.]

The members of an organization are legally responsible for (% of their Mezonos they gave to the organization at the time of the action)/(number of members at the time of the action) of the actions of the organization.

### Voting
With citizen voting by default every citizen has one vote, however a citizen can give a portion or all of their voting power to another citizen resulting in a citizen having more than 1 citizen votes.

Mezono Consensus is where every citizen has a number of votes equal to the number of Mezonos allocated to them that are not frozen.

A citizen may give any amount of their voting power to any citizen or organization (regardless if they are a member of the organization). They can give their voting power unconditionally, for a specific amount of time, for a specific proposal, concerning certain topics, or any combination of these conditions. A citizen may take back their voting power at any time.

[How long does voting on things stay open?]
[People may change their vote as long as the voting is open?]
[Organizations can vote with the citizen and mezono voting power they are given]
[Allow citizens to unvote?]
[Allow giving of your voting power on specific proposals, or on specific genres of things such as foreign trade]

### Knowledge Pool
All knowledge, digital files, and nonphysical/intangible objects go to the knowledge pool which are available to everyone regardless of which Mezo system they are a part of.

This Knowledge Pool operates on IPFS. For more information visit ipfs.io

Mezo does not allow for intellectual property.

### Resource Pool
The resource pool is distributed and decentralized, everything in it has an ID and a mezono value equal to the (sum of the input costs of all of that specific item from that specific entity)/(Number of that specific item produced by those specfic input costs from that specific entity. [People may set their own prices ideally at the price of the input costs for that resource, however there is no mechanism enforcing this. People may have an incentive to lie, but consumers will purchase the item for the lowest price thus creating competition and driving prices down their truthful prices. In any case a person cannot price something for more mezonos than they have ever spent.]

An entity may not price resources in such a way that the sum of all the resources they have listed in the resource pool exceeds the amount mezonos that entity has spent.

When an entity finishes the production of a good and gives it to the resource pool, and another entity exchanges Mezonos for that good, those Mezonos will be given to the entity who created that good. The value of the good is the sum of the value of the resources that went into the production of the good divided by the number of that good produced by those resources.

An entity may remove the listing of a resource in the resource pool.

[People remove things of their own volition if they feel it has gone bad (for example if an apple has gone bad then it will be removed from the resource pool), this will raise the price of all the other of that same good because of the now lower quantity. This kind of behavior of self regulation is incentivized as the act of not doing so results in a artifically lower price and products that have gone bad and cannot be shipped]

### Land
When land is added to the resource pool entities bid for it, with the largest bid exchanging their bid amount for the land. Bidding is open for a term of [blank].

This process of bidding sets the price for the land

If an entity bids more mezonos than what the entity who possesed the land before had paid for it, the entity who possesed the land before cannot receive more mezonos than what they had paid for the land.

[Or maybe when I am finished with a plot of land it is re-put on the land registry as a new item and gets rebidded on, I only get my mezonos back for the land when someone else purchases the land, if they do so for less than what I initially payed I dont get all my mezonos back. People would bid less if the land was less attractive so if i bid a lot when i got it was attractive, then i exploited it and decreased its value therefore it is only fair i pay the environmental costs of my actions and the land's value goes down.
All products made from the land plot before it was sold to someone else, are priced with the input cost of the land at that time. All products from the land plot after it was sold, are priced with the input of the cost of the land with the new price.
However if someone pays more mezonos than what I initially payed for the land (this could be because I cultivated the land), I do not get back any more mezonos than what I initially payed for the land. However the new land is priced with what the new person payed for it. This allows for no profits to be kept while having realistic pricing. Those mezonos which exceed my initial input costs are just discarded.]

### Meta Mezo
If multiple Mezo systems allocate resources with the approximately the same proportions for an extended amount of time and those Mezo systems have more than 80% Mezono consensus within each respective Mezo system to merge, those Mezo systems will merge into one Mezo system. (How is this similarity mathematically measured)

This collection of Mezo Systems is Meta Mezo.

Once a person becomes a citizen of a particular Mezo system, that citizen can not move to a different Mezo system. [This rule will be changed]

[HOW TO SOLVE FOR DIFFERENCES IN LAW, AND DIFFERENCES IN FEAUTURES TOGGLED]

### Foreign Trade
Anyone can submit a trade proposal for an asset at a rate of exchange and quantity.

If 75% Mezono concensus is reached in regard to allowing trade of an asset with a foreign institution at a rate and quantity defined by the trade proposal, he resource pool may trade that asset with a foreign institution at the rate and quantity defined by the trade proposal until a later proposal. Otherwise the proposal will not be put into effect.
[CHANGE TO BETTER SYSTEM OF PROPOSING TRADES AND APPROVING THEM]

### MEZOL
Mezo practices polycentric law. Citizens may follow the law of the nation they reside in as long as they follow the laws of Mezo as well. In all cases the Mezo Constitution and MEZOL supersede all other systems of law.

Laws cannot be added or removed to MEZOL if they contradict the Mezo Constitution. If the rules in the Mezo Constitution and MEZOL give conflicting results, the rule listed in the Mezo Constitution prevails.

[HOW TO ADD AND REMOVE LAWS]
[Replace word Polycentric, with more common words]
 
### Judicial Holon
Any citizen or entity can present a case to the Judicial Holon.

A Judicial Holon verdict may only be put into effect on a case in which a party is explicitly physically or financially involved by the actions of another party. The only exception to this rule, is that a member of the Military Holon may present a case to the Judicial Holon and allow for a Judicial Holon verdict to be put into effect on a case, whether or not the military holon member is explicitly, physically, or, financially involved by the actions of another party.

Judicial Holon verdicts are based on the Mezo Constitution and MEZOL.

A guilty verdict will result in the guilty citizen’s mezonos being frozen. [PARTIAL FROZEN?]

A guilty verdict can be repealed after sufficient unfunded contribution to society. Whether the actions are sufficient enough to warrant repealing of a guilty verdict will be determined by the judicial holon.

Verdicts will be reached given at least majority Mezono consensus from the judges involved in the case.

[CHANGE TO REFLECT HOW JUDGES WORK IN MEZOL]
[Should Judicial Holon be a holon or something else which doesnt use mezonos, like a council?]

### Military Holon
Enforces verdict as determined  by Judicial Holon. (This means that the Military Holon does not enforce the Mezo Constitution nor does it enforce MEZOL. It may only enforce Judicial Holon verdicts. This prevents preemptive military action.)

If 75% or more of non Military Holon Mezonos agree to end foreign interaction or that the Military Holon is violating the Mezo constitution/MEZOL, Military Holon Mezonos will be frozen until a later proposal.

If 75% or more of non Military Holon mezonos agree to unfreeze Military Holon Mezonos, Military Holon Mezonos will be unfrozen.

### Education Holon
All citizens are by default in the Education Holon.

In order for a citizen to move to a holon they must be certified by the education special holon with that holon.

The requirement for certification to enter a holon can be enabled or disabled. The default setting is enabled.

A citizen's mezonos are frozen and are unfrozen at a rate of [ENTER RATE] until they either pass certification (this feature can be enabled or disabled) or when that citizen reaches age 25 (this feature can be enabled or disabled). This age can be changed and will be the average of all the ages voted by all the citizens. (Outliers will be removed from average calculation). The rate of unfreezing can be changed. This feature of mezono freezing can be enabled or disabled, by default it is enabled.
[Who decides what certification means, and what the standards are and how to test it]

### Defining Munit
As a holon produces a good to the extent to which it can be distributed to at least 100% of the population without inhibiting the ability to distribute all other goods in a munit to 100% of the population, it will be added to the definition of a Munit upon 80% or more Mezono consensus. This consensus percentage can be changed.

Upon at least 80% Mezono consensus a good will be removed from the definition of a Munit. This consensus percentage can be changed.

### Enabling and Disabling Features
The amount of citizen consensus needed to enable, disable, or change a rule that can be enabled, disabled, or changed is by default 90%. This citizen consensus percentage for this rule can be changed.

While Mezo creates an open knowledge society, the Mezo system and constitution is not copyright-free. This is because altering and running non connected Mezo clones would factionalize Society and could lead to wars and inhumane treatment that fall outside the aims and goals Mezo tries to achieve.
